"Early Grade Retention Harms Adult Earnings" (Job market paper)

> Abstract: This paper provides the first causal evidence of the effects of grade retention on labor market outcomes using Texas’ policy of retaining third graders who fail a reading test. The fuzzy regression discontinuity design estimates show that grade retention reduces earnings 15 years later by $4513 (35%), raising violence and absenteeism and reducing high school graduation rates. These findings suggest that grade retention is ineffective in aiding struggling students to catch up academically and disadvantages them in the labor market. Moreover, higher retention rates among Black and Hispanic students, coupled with significant reductions in earnings, contribute to perpetuating racial earnings inequality.

 "Can Social Media Rhetoric Incite Hate Incidents? Evidence from Trump's "Chinese Virus" Tweets" (corresponding author, joint with Andy Cao and Jason M. Lindo), and 
 ***revised and resubmitted*** to Journal of Urban Economics. This paper is available at <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30588"> NBER </a>.

> Abstract: We investigate whether Donald Trump's "Chinese Virus" tweets contributed to the rise of anti-Asian incidents. We find that the number of incidents spiked following Trump’s initial “Chinese Virus” tweets and the subsequent dramatic rise in internet search activity for the phrase. Difference-in-differences and event-study analyses leveraging spatial variation indicates that this spike in anti-Asian incidents was significantly more pronounced in counties that supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election relative to those that supported Hillary Clinton. We estimate that anti-Asian incidents spiked by 4000 percentage points in Trump-supporting counties, over and above the spike observed in Clinton-supporting counties.

"The Effect of Pollution on Human Capital Formation: Evidence from Wind Energy and Aviation Fuel" (Joint with Thao Duong)

> Abstract: This paper examines the causal impact of lead exposure on students’ cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes by leveraging a quasi-random variation from the unregulated leaded gasoline use in piston-engine aircraft (PEA) that fell consistently after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We find that each PEA flight would significantly increase the lead concentration for areas near the airports, leaving areas further away from the airports with little to no effect. Exploiting the exogenous decrease in the lead deposition for schools near the airports, we employ difference-in-difference to estimate the causal effect of lead exposure on test scores. We find that lead exposure from PEA operations significantly negatively affects students’ test scores. Reduction in lead exposure also significantly decreases criminal activities. This paper has tremendous implications for regulating lead pollution on human capital development in the setting of low-level lead pollution.


"The Impact of English Proficient Reclassification on Long-Term Educational and Earnings Outcomes" (Joint with Sijia Zhang, Yayun Chen)

> Abstract: Many states have assessed English proficiency for English learners in light of Title III. Given that over 10\% of public elementary and secondary school students in the United States are English learners, a thorough investigation into the long-term implications of reclassification is warranted. In this paper, we employ data from the Texas Education Research Center that links educational records with labor market outcomes to provide a causal assessment of the long-term impact of English proficient reclassification on earnings. Our results, obtained via a regression discontinuity design, indicate that reclassification as English proficient in grade 3 has a statistically significant and positive impact on earnings 17 years later. However, we also find that attaining English proficiency in grade 5 has a statistically significant and negative impact on earnings. Finally, our results indicate no statistically significant effects on earnings for later grades. These findings provide crucial insights into the long-term implications of English proficient reclassification for students' economic well-being.
