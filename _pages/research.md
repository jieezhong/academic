***"Can Social Media Rhetoric Incite Hate Incidents? Evidence from Trump's "Chinese Virus" Tweets"*** (Corresponding Author, Joint with Andy Cao and Jason M. Lindo), ***<ins> Journal of Urban Economics (Forthcoming)</ins>.***

> Abstract: We investigate whether Donald Trump's "Chinese Virus" tweets contributed to the rise of anti-Asian incidents. We find that the number of incidents spiked following Trump’s initial “Chinese Virus” tweets and the subsequent dramatic rise in internet search activity for the phrase. Difference-in-differences and event-study analyses leveraging spatial variation indicate that this spike in anti-Asian incidents was significantly more pronounced in counties that supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election relative to those that supported Hillary Clinton. We estimate that anti-Asian incidents spiked by approximately 4200 percent in Trump-supported counties compared to an increase of approximately 200 percent in Clinton-supported counties. 

## WORKING PAPERS

***"Early Grade Retention Harms Adult Earnings" (Job Market Paper), Revise and Resubmit to <ins> American Economic Journal: Applied Economics </ins>***

> Abstract: This paper provides the first causal evidence of the effects of grade retention on labor market outcomes using Texas’ policy of retaining third graders who fail a reading test. The fuzzy regression discontinuity design estimates show that grade retention reduces earnings 15 years later by $4513 (35%), raising violence and absenteeism and reducing high school graduation rates. These findings suggest that grade retention is ineffective in aiding struggling students to catch up academically and disadvantages them in the labor market. Moreover, higher retention rates among Black and Hispanic students, coupled with significant reductions in earnings, contribute to perpetuating racial earnings inequality.

> ***"Lead in the Air: Unraveling the Long-Term Impacts of Lead Exposure"*** (Joint with Thao Duong)

> Abstract: We study the enduring influence of early childhood lead exposure on long-term earnings and educational outcomes while illuminating the mechanisms behind these effects. Capitalizing on a unique natural experiment resulting from the decline in leaded gasoline use in piston-engine aircraft (PEA) post 9/11, we show that even a slight reduction in lead exposure can significantly bolster earnings between ages 23 and 29 among students in grades 4 to 8. Further results demonstrate that a moderate reduction in lead exposure increases test scores, improves high school graduation rates, increases university or college enrollment, and has no significant effect on risky behaviors. 


***"The Impact of English Proficient Reclassification on Long-Term Educational and Earnings Outcomes"*** (Joint with Yayun Chen, Sijia Zhang)

> Abstract: Many states have assessed English proficiency for English learners in light of Title III. Given that over 10\% of public elementary and secondary school students in the United States are English learners, a thorough investigation into the long-term implications of reclassification is warranted. In this paper, we employ data from the Texas Education Research Center that links educational records with labor market outcomes to provide a causal assessment of the long-term impact of English proficient reclassification on earnings. The regression discontinuity design results show that being reclassified as English proficient in grade 3 significantly increases high school graduation rates and earnings 17 years later. However, there are no significant effects on test scores, risky behaviors, and college enrollment.
