## WORKING PAPERS

"School retention and inequities in educational and earnings outcomes." (Job market paper)

> This paper uses the fuzzy RD method to study the long-term effects of grade retention on earnings outcomes by race and ethnicity in the context of Texas's third-grade retention policy. In spite of results indicating that grade retention improves reading scores in the short run, it reduces earnings in the long run. Moreover, the adverse long-term effects vary by race and ethnicity. Specifically, grade retention reduces earnings for Hispanic (by 24\%) and African American students (by 61\%). While white students are less likely to graduate high school as a result of retention, the adverse effects on earnings are inconclusive.

"Did Trump’s “Chinese Virus” Tweets Result in Anti-Asian Behavior?" (Joint with Andy Cao and Jason M. Lindo), revise and resubmit to Journal of Urban Economics

> We investigate whether Donald Trump's "Chinese Virus" tweets contributed to the rise of anti-Asian incidents. We find that the number of incidents spiked following Trump’s initial “Chinese Virus” tweets and the subsequent dramatic rise in internet search activity for the phrase. Results from an event-study analysis indicate that this spike in anti-Asian incidents was significantly more pronounced in counties that supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election relative to those that supported Hillary Clinton. We estimate that the relative increase in anti-Asian incidents in Trump-supporting counties was over 12 times the baseline rate in such counties during the prior week.
