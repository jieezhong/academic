## WORKING PAPERS

### "Does the test-based grade retention policy exacerbate or mitigate racial and ethnic inequality?" (Job market paper)

> This paper uses the fuzzy RD method to study the effects of grade retention on earnings and educational outcomes by race and ethnicity in Texas’s third-grade test-based retention policy. Despite results indicating that grade retention improves their reading scores in the short run, it adversely increases the days of absence, especially for African American students. Retention also increases the chance of being expelled and displayed in disciplinary alternative education program (DAEP). In the long run, third-grade retention unfavorably reduces earnings. The negative impacts on earnings are concentrated on African American and Hispanic students. Specifically, grade retention significantly reduces earnings at age 23 by 61% for African American students and by 24% for Hispanic students. While white students are less likely to graduate from high school because of retention, the adverse effects on earnings are inconclusive. 

### "Did Trump’s “Chinese Virus” Tweets Result in Anti-Asian Behavior?" (corresponding author, joint with Andy Cao and Jason M. Lindo), revise and resubmit to Journal of Urban Economics

> We investigate whether Donald Trump's "Chinese Virus" tweets contributed to the rise of anti-Asian incidents. We find that the number of incidents spiked following Trump’s initial “Chinese Virus” tweets and the subsequent dramatic rise in internet search activity for the phrase. Results from an event-study analysis indicate that this spike in anti-Asian incidents was significantly more pronounced in counties that supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election relative to those that supported Hillary Clinton. We estimate that the relative increase in anti-Asian incidents in Trump-supporting counties was over 12 times the baseline rate in such counties during the prior week.
