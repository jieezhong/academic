## WORKING PAPERS

"Help or Harm? New Evidence on Grade Retention's Long-run Effects" (Job market paper)

> Abstract: While there exists widespread and increasing use of grade retention, there is continued disagreement over whether this practice is helpful for students. This paper provides the first causal evidence of the effect of grade retention on labor market outcomes by leveraging a discontinuity in the likelihood of being retained at a cutoff generated by Texas' third-grade test-based retention policy. The results demonstrate that Black and Hispanic students are retained at a higher rate than White students, even conditional on test scores. Importantly, holding students back in the third grade reduces earnings 15 years after grade 3 by $4513 (35\%). The reduction in earnings is likely driven by increased behavioral issues like violence and the absence of class. While third-grade retention reduces the times of being retained after grade 3 and might temporally increase reading scores, these cognitive achievements seem to be outweighed by the adverse effects on behavioral issues. This leads to a decrease in high school graduation and reductions in earnings. Given the disparate retention rates among Black and Hispanic students and substantial reductions in earnings, this paper implies that grade retention exacerbates racial earnings inequality.  

 "Can Social Media Rhetoric Incite Hate Incidents? Evidence from Trump's "Chinese Virus" Tweets" (corresponding author, joint with Andy Cao and Jason M. Lindo), and 
 ***revised and resubmitted*** to Journal of Urban Economics

> Abstract: We investigate whether Donald Trump's "Chinese Virus" tweets contributed to the rise of anti-Asian incidents. We find that the number of incidents spiked following Trump’s initial “Chinese Virus” tweets and the subsequent dramatic rise in internet search activity for the phrase. Difference-in-differences and event-study analyses leveraging spatial variation indicates that this spike in anti-Asian incidents was significantly more pronounced in counties that supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election relative to those that supported Hillary Clinton. We estimate that anti-Asian incidents spiked by 4000 percentage points in Trump-supporting counties, over and above the spike observed in Clinton-supporting counties. 

## WORK IN PROGRESS

"The Effect of Pollution on Human Capital Formation: Evidence from Wind Energy and Aviation Fuel" (Joint with Thao Duong)

> Abstract: This paper examines whether air quality and students’ outcomes are dose-responsive to the levels of lead deposition. We take advantage of the unregulated leaded gasoline use in piston-engine aircraft (PEA) and leverage a quasi-experiment where PEA operations fell consistently after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Using a fixed-effect model, we estimate the relationship between PEA operation and airborne lead concentration. We find that each PEA flight would significantly increase the lead concentration for areas near the airports, leaving areas further away from the airports with little to no effect. Exploiting the exogenous decrease in the lead deposition for schools near the airports, we employ difference-in-difference to estimate the causal effect of lead exposure on test scores. The preliminary result shows that lead exposure from PEA operation has a negative and cumulative effect on students’ test scores.
