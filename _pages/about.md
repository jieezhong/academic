I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at [Texas A&M University](https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/economics/) in College Station. I am on the Job Market for the 2023-2024 academic year.

My research expertise lies at the intersection of education, labor, environmental, health, and crime economics. Much of my research is tied together by my interest in using causal inference methods to estimate the long-term impact of early childhood education policies and school environments on key life outcomes such as earnings, education, and risky behavior.

***Research Areas***: 
- Education Economics
- Labor Economics
- Environmental Economics
- Health Economics
- Crime Economics
