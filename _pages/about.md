I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at [Texas A&M University](https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/economics/). I will join the Department of Economics at [Miami University] in Ohio (https://miamioh.edu/index.html) as an Assistant Professor in the fall of 2024.

At the core of my research is a dedication to employing advanced causal inference methods to answer how public policies and environmental factors shape human capital development, labor market outcomes, and social equity. I am broadly interested in education, labor, environmental, and health economics.

***Research Areas:***
- Labor Economics
