I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at [Texas A&M University](https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/economics/) in College Station.

My research expertise lies at the intersection of education, labor, crime, environmental, and health economics. My research endeavors primarily shed light on the profound, long-term impact of early childhood education policies and school environments on key life outcomes such as education, risk behavior, and earnings.

In my significant job market paper, I investigated the deleterious effects of third-grade retention on labor income, education, and risk behaviors. Crucially, the findings underscore the augmentation of racial income inequality due to the disproportionate impact of this policy on Black and Hispanic students.

Currently, I am broadening my research horizons by probing into the enduring effects of pre-kindergarten education programs, reclassification of English learners, exposure to lead pollution, and encounters with abusive teachers on children's long-term prospects.
Beyond the realm of education economics, my expertise extends to crime economics, evidenced by a working paper investigating social media rhetoric's influence on the prevalence of hate incidents. 

Collectively, my research pursuits are geared towards enriching our understanding of the long-term effects of public policies. Through this endeavor, I aim to provide valuable insights that can be instrumental in fostering improved outcomes for children.
