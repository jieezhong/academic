I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at [Texas A&M University](https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/economics/) in College Station.

My research interests encompass various areas of economics, including education, labor, environmental, crime, and health economics. A central theme of my research is to examine the enduring effects of public policies on educational and labor market outcomes. Specifically, my job market paper has shed light on the harmful effects of grade retention on risk behavior and labor market outcomes among low-achieving students. Additionally, my ongoing research delves into the long-term impacts of lead pollution on educational and labor market outcomes. Furthermore, my research portfolio is shaped by my interest in crime and health economics, as evident in my work investigating the relationship between hate incidents and social media rhetoric and the impact of Tobacco 21 laws on youth substance use.

***Research Areas***: 
- Education economics
