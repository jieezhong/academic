I am an Assistant Professor in the Economics Department at [Miami University](https://miamioh.edu/fsb/directory/?up=/query/all/all/Economics/all) in Ohio.

At the core of my research is a dedication to employing advanced causal inference methods to answer how public policies and environmental factors shape human capital development, labor market outcomes, and social equity. I am broadly interested in education, labor, environmental, and health economics.

***Research Areas:***
