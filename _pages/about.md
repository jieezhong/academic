I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at [Texas A&M University](https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/economics/) in College Station.

My research expertise lies at the intersection of education, labor, crime, and health economics. My primary focus is assessing the persistent effects of public policies on education, criminal activity, and labor market performance outcomes.

In my job market paper, I examined the detrimental consequences of grade retention on labor market outcomes and risk behavior among low-achieving students. I am undertaking research projects to explore the lasting impacts of lead pollution and the reclassification of English learners on educational, criminal, and labor market outcomes. Additionally, my working paper examines the relationship between social media rhetoric and hate incidents.

My research interests also extend to health economics, as evidenced by my ongoing research on the impact of the Tobacco 21 policy on youth behaviors and substance use.

Overall, my research aims to contribute to a better understanding of the consequences of public policies and inform evidence-based policy decisions that promote positive outcomes in education, criminal activity, labor markets, and public health. By evaluating the long-term effects of public policies, my work aims to provide insights that can guide policymakers in developing more effective and sustainable policy interventions.
