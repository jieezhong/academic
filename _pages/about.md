I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at [Texas A&M University](https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/economics/). I am on the Job Market for the 2023-2024 academic year.

My research expertise lies in the interaction of education, labor, environmental, and health economics. Much of my research is tied together by my interest in using causal inference methods to estimate the long-term impacts of early childhood education policies and school environments on key life outcomes such as earnings, education, and behavioral issues.

***Research Areas:***
- Labor Economics
- Education Economics
- Environmental Economics
- Health Economics
