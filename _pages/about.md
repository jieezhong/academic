I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Economics Department at [Texas A&M University](https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/economics/) in College Station.

I am interested in studying public policiesâ€™ short and long-term impacts and how they impact inequality. My current work studies the impacts of grade retention and lead pollution on education, and labor market outcomes, especially for disadvantaged populations.

I am on the Job Market for the 2022-2023 academic year.

***Research Areas***: education economics, environmental economics, health economics, and crime economics.
