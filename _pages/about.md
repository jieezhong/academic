I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Economics](https://miamioh.edu/fsb/directory/?up=/query/all/all/Economics/all) at [Miami University](https://miamioh.edu/index.html) in Ohio. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [Department of Economics](https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/economics/) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html) in May 2024.

At the core of my research is a dedication to employing advanced causal inference methods to answer how public policies and environmental factors shape human capital development, labor market outcomes, and social equity. I am broadly interested in education, labor, environmental, and health economics.
