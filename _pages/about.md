People cannot choose where they were born. Some were born from families with lots of resources, while others come from families with nothing. Education and environment play critical roles in changing one’s fate. I am interested to see whether and how educational policy and environment mitigate or exacerbate inequality between disadvantaged and advantaged groups.

While it is well known that education helps reduce inequality, some educational policies exacerbate inequality. My dissertation research provides new causal evidence of the adverse impacts of third-grade retention policy on risk behaviors and labor market outcomes, especially for African American and Hispanic students. The results imply that third-grade retention exacerbates racial earnings inequality. My ongoing paper also explores the effects of environment, such as lead exposure and noise and light pollutions, on educational and labor market outcomes. My research agenda is also tied together by my interest in crime and health economics, which is reflected in my papers focusing on the effects of Donald Trump’s ”Chinese Virus” tweets on the rise of anti-Asian incidents and the Tobacco 21 laws on youth substance use.
